# Group Project

This is the repository for your group project, keep it neat and well organised with sensible folder structures.

There is **no** need to create archived builds of your project or to keep any old files - everything is automatically archived for you.

**Note** that these repositories are visible to anyone, so it is your chance to publically demonstrate your ability to work in a professional and considered manner.
